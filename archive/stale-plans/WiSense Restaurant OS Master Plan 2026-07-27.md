# WiSense Restaurant OS — Master Plan

> The big vision: one system that runs the entire restaurant. Scheduling, ordering, labor cost, tip management, shift handoffs, customer flow. No competitor does this. This is the dream.

## The Vision

Walk into a restaurant. The owner is running everything from their phone:

- Staff see their schedule in Apex, get push notifications, swap shifts, clock in
- Customers order from the website, tickets print to the kitchen
- The owner sees labor cost vs revenue in real time
- When a rush hits, the system auto-pauses ordering based on who's on shift
- When someone calls out, the system texts available employees to fill the gap
- Tips are tracked and split automatically
- Shift handoff notes pass from the day shift to the night shift
- The owner closes out the night: $2,400 in sales, $480 in labor (20%), 47 orders, 3 no-shows handled

That's not a scheduling app. That's not a website. That's a restaurant operating system. And nobody else sells one.

## What Exists Today (Built)

### Apex Scheduler (staff side)
- Shift scheduling, drag-and-drop
- Shift swaps and covers
- Availability and time-off requests
- Time clock (clock in/out)
- Sidework assignments
- Push notifications
- Multi-tenant (organization_id)
- Flutter + Supabase, 95% complete

### Jigsy's Ordering Platform (customer side)
- 52-item menu, categories, modifiers
- Cart, checkout, pickup scheduling
- Staff console: accept/reject, pause/reopen, sold-out controls
- Kitchen ticket printing (80mm thermal)

- Cloudflare Workers + D1 database
- Live at jigsys-ordering-demo.wisense.workers.dev

### WiSense LLC Website (portfolio)
- wisensellc.com — 5 ventures, before/after demo, pricing, journal

## The OS — What Connects Them

### Phase 1: SHARED DATA LAYER
Both systems read/write to one Supabase database:
- Apex: shifts, time_entries, availability, swaps, staff
- Ordering: orders, menu, settings, fees
- New shared tables: labor_cost_daily, revenue_daily, shift_handoff_log, tip_pool

### Phase 2: LABOR VS REVENUE DASHBOARD
- Apex time clock data + ordering sales data = real-time labor cost percentage
- Owner sees: "Tonight: $2,400 sales, $480 labor = 20%. Last Friday: $3,100 sales, $520 labor = 17%."
- Alerts when labor exceeds 30% of projected sales
- Weekly trend: are you overstaffing slow nights?

### Phase 3: SMART ORDERING CAPACITY
- Ordering system checks Apex schedule before accepting orders
- "You have 1 cook on shift. Max 15 orders/hour. Order #16 gets 'longer wait time' warning."
- Auto-pause ordering when critically understaffed
- Auto-resume when the next cook clocks in
- No competitor does this

### Phase 4: NO-SHOW / CALL-OUT ENGINE
- Staff member marks themselves "can't make it" in Apex
- System auto-texts all available employees with matching role: "Mike called out for tonight 5-11. Can you cover? Tap yes."
- First responder gets the shift
- Ordering system adjusts capacity if no one fills it
- No competitor does this

### Phase 5: TIP MANAGEMENT
- Owner enters tip pool at end of shift
- System splits by hours worked (from time clock data)
- Employees see their tip breakdown in the app
- 7shifts charges $49.99/mo for this. You include it.

### Phase 6: MANAGER LOG BOOK
- Shift handoff notes: "Walk-in fridge is down. Called repair. Prep extra for tomorrow."
- Day shift → night shift → next day
- Attach photos of issues
- 7shifts charges $14.99/mo for this. You include it.

### Phase 7: OFFLINE MODE
- Kitchen WiFi is unreliable
- Apex works offline, syncs when reconnected
- Orders queue locally, sync when connection returns
- No competitor does this

## The Pricing — Dream Big

### Tier 1: Starter (foot in the door)
- **Free** — 1 location, up to 20 employees

## Revenue Projections — Dream Big

| Clients | Tier | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pro ($25/mo) | $25 | $300 |
| 5 | Pro ($25/mo) | $125 | $1,500 |
| 10 | Pro ($25/mo) | $250 | $3,000 |
| 5 | OS ($99/mo) | $495 | $5,940 |
| 10 | OS ($99/mo) | $990 | $11,880 |
| 20 | OS ($99/mo) | $1,980 | $23,760 |
| 10 OS + 10 Pro | Mixed | $1,240 | $14,880 |

| 50 OS clients | OS only | $4,950 | $59,400 |

At 50 OS clients at $99/mo, that's nearly $60K/year in recurring revenue. From one product. Built on code you already have.

## The Moat — Why Nobody Else Can Do This Easily

1. **7shifts can't add ordering** — they're a scheduling company. Adding a full ordering platform is a different product. They'd need to build or acquire one.
2. **ChowNow/Slice can't add scheduling** — they're ordering companies. Adding staff scheduling is a different product.
3. **Toast does both but costs $1,000+/mo** — Toast is a POS system with scheduling and ordering, but it's enterprise-priced and requires their hardware.
4. **Square has both but they're disconnected** — Square POS + Square Online + Square Scheduling are separate products that don't talk to each other.
5. **You connect scheduling + ordering + labor cost in one system** — nobody does this for small independent restaurants at an affordable price.

The gap in the market: affordable, restaurant-specific, scheduling + ordering + labor optimization in one system. That's the OS.

## Build Order (Don't Build the OS Before You Have Users)

1. **SHIP APEX** — Friday: buy accounts, keystores, .aab, Google Play. Apply RLS migration to Supabase.
2. **GET 1-2 RESTAURANTS USING APEX FREE** — Jigsy's + 1 cold prospect. Free tier.
3. **SHIP ORDERING PLATFORM** — Jigsy's approves, go live. Get 1-2 restaurants paying for websites + ordering.
4. **CONNECT THEM** — shared Supabase data layer. Labor vs revenue dashboard. This is the OS prototype.
5. **ADD TIP MANAGEMENT + LOG BOOK** — these are easy builds (CRUD + math) but high value (competitors charge extra for them).
6. **PITCH THE OS** — "I don't just build websites. I run your restaurant. Scheduling, ordering, labor cost, tips, shift handoffs. $99/mo. One system."
7. **SCALE** — 10 OS clients = $1,188/mo. 20 = $2,376/mo. 50 = $4,950/mo.

## What to Build First After Apex Ships

### Quick wins (1 weekend each, high differentiator value):

1. **Manager log book** — CRUD + timestamps. 7shifts charges $14.99/mo for this. You include it free in Pro.
2. **Tip management** — owner enters pool, system splits by hours from time clock. 7shifts charges $49.99/mo. You include it free in Pro.
3. **Labor cost dashboard** — time clock hours × hourly rate vs shift schedule. Shows overstaffing in real time.
4. **No-show call-out engine** — staff marks "can't make it" → system texts available employees. Nobody else does this.

Each of these is a weekend build. Each one is a feature competitors charge extra for or don't have. Stack them up and you have the OS.

## The Pitch (When the OS is Ready)

"Every restaurant runs on 3 disconnected systems: a scheduling app, a POS, and a website. They don't talk to each other. The owner manually checks three dashboards, three apps, three logins.

WiSense Restaurant OS is one system. Your staff schedule, your customer orders, your labor cost, your tips, your shift handoffs — all in one place. When a rush hits, the system knows who's on shift and adjusts ordering capacity. When someone calls out, the system finds a replacement automatically. When you close out the night, you see exactly what you made and what you spent.

$99/month. One system. One login. One price.

No per-user charges. No add-ons. No POS hardware required.

I built this for Jigsy's Brewpub in Enola. They reduced labor cost from 32% to 24% and eliminated missed orders during Friday rushes. I'll build you a free demo."

## The 5-Year Dream

- 100 OS clients at $99/mo = $118,800/year recurring
- 50 Pro clients at $25/mo = $15,000/year recurring

- Plus one-time website setups ($299 each)
- Plus the website care plans ($79/mo each)
- You're a one-person software company serving independent restaurants

- Run from your phone on off-weekends

That's the dream. Build it one step at a time. Ship Apex first.
